		Title: BigMech
		Armor: heavy
		Armament: two light rocket launchers
		Description: At first glance, this heavily armed battle machine doesn't seem very impressively equipped.\nBut rest assured, the BigMech is definitely one of the UCS' most impressive weapons.\nIts two fast-firing light rocket launchers fire 16 rockets in a row and take very little time to load.
