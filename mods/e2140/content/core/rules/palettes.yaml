	# This is necessary for some widgets like SpriteWidget, which is used in the Asset Browser.
	# But in order to get rid of it, we'd have to change some chrome definitions, that is included from mods/common.
	# We currently don't need to change Asset Browser chrome definition, so we keep this palette here for compatibility purposes.
